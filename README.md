Crypto Tracker for KDE
======================
Plasma/KDE multi crypto currency price tracker widget, with support for multiple exchanges and currency pairs.

![Widget vertical](docs/img/widget01.png) ![Widget horizontal](docs/img/widget02.png) ![Widget bg flash](docs/img/widget03.gif)

Currently setup up to 6 different cryptos to track, but this is pretty artificial limit and will be soon
lifted once I will have the time to rework configuration UI to properly handle unlimited number of entries
(which is already internally supported).

> Please note that current version may not support exchange or currency pair you like simply because
> I did not need them. As long as there's JSON ticker available for the given pair on exchange of your
> choice it can be easily added to the widget. Please [fill a new ticket](https://github.com/MarcinOrlowski/crypto-tracker-plasmoid/issues)
> for specific exchange, pair to be added.
