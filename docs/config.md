### Layout ###
This pane controls how the widgets places exchange details in its internal layout grid.

![Layout](img/config-layout.png)

* **Use custom grid layout**: By default Crypto Trackers puts all enabled exchanges either in single
  row (or single column) depending on your Panel orientation. This option lets you override this behavior
  and manually specify how many rows and columns your desired layout should be using.
* **Rows**: Number of rows you want the custom layout grid to use.
* **Columns**: Number of columns you want the custom layout grid to use.
* **Transparent background**: When checked, widget background be fully transparent, otherwise theme
  derrived background is used. **NOTE** this option is not available (hidden) if you use Plasma 5.19
  or newer, as it offers own, built-in mechanism to set plasmoid transparent background which is 
  preferred if available.
